To classify which Game of Thrones character you are, put your plan in a sentence or two of how you would conquer the iron throne in plan.txt. Then run `python scripts/classify.py`.

The code to generate the classifier is also in scripts/ . Call from the base directory scripts/generate_classifier.py . The classifier is about 20 percent accurate on the test data, where as guessing the mode would be about 18 percent accurate.

The training data was found on wiki quotes and is in the data/ directory. There are several typos and multiple spellings on author names, but it is a fairly decent data source over all.

The classifier and vectorizer are stored as pickles in the pickles/ directory.
